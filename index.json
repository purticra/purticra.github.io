Currently maintaining a 4.00 GPA while diving deep into mechatronics and robotics prototyping.\nWhat I Do # My work sits at the intersection of electrical systems, mechanical design, and intelligent control. I enjoy taking ideas from concept to physical prototype, whether that\u0026rsquo;s designing microwave filters in a research lab or building bionic robots that swim across water surfaces.\nI\u0026rsquo;m particularly drawn to projects that require creative problem-solving and rapid iteration. From winning hackathons with moon rover designs to developing imitation learning grippers for manufacturing, I thrive in environments where theory meets hands-on engineering.\nMy Background # Before Georgia Tech, I spent time working on some fascinating projects in China. At Shanghai Huatai Automation, I designed control systems and mechanical structures for robotic grippers. At Ningbo University\u0026rsquo;s Intelligent Wireless Technology Lab, I worked on high-frequency RF circuits and substrate-integrated waveguide filters.\nOne of my most ambitious early projects was designing a bionic frog robot that could maneuver on water surfaces using pneumatic actuators. That project taught me the value of biomimetic design and earned me a spot showcasing at ISEF 2024 in Los Angeles.\nTechnical Toolkit # I work across multiple domains. On the mechanical side, I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable with CAD modeling in Fusion 360, 3D printing, laser cutting, and general fabrication. For electronics, I design PCBs, work with embedded systems, and can navigate everything from oscilloscopes to vector network analyzers.\nMy programming spans C++, Python, and Java, and I\u0026rsquo;ve used tools ranging from Ansys HFSS for electromagnetic simulation to Arduino for rapid prototyping.\nCurrent Focus # Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m involved with Hytech Racing\u0026rsquo;s Electrical Control Department and staying active in the hackathon scene. Recently, my team won first place at the GT IEEE Robotech Hackathon with our MoonLine rover design, where I served as chief mechanical designer.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also working on µCHIMERA, a stackable nano-power generation device that combines piezoelectric elements with smart design for the Inventure Prize 2026.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next # I\u0026rsquo;m seeking internship opportunities in mechatronics and product prototyping for Summer or Fall 2026. I\u0026rsquo;m especially interested in roles that let me work on physical products from initial concept through manufacturing.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re working on something interesting in robotics, automation, or hardware development, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Connect # Feel free to reach out at hlyu68@gatech.edu or connect with me on LinkedIn. I\u0026rsquo;m always happy to discuss projects, exchange ideas, or explore collaboration opportunities.\nBased in Atlanta, GA | Speaking Chinese and English\n","date":"Feb 1, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Homepage","summary":"Hi, I’m Hongyi # I’m an Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech with a passion for building things that move, sense, and interact with the world around them.
